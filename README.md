[![BenchWrk](https://i.postimg.cc/NMfYwnxN/doc-2025-08-22-17-07-42.png)](https://benchwrk.com)

This VSCode extension designed to streamline log management across diverse sources. The extension enables developers to fetch, view, and analyze logs in real-time from platforms like Sentry (for error tracking), AWS CloudWatch (for cloud infrastructure logs), and Coolify (for deployment and container logs). Key features include:

- **Unified Dashboard**: Aggregate logs from multiple sources into a single VSCode panel for easy monitoring.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically pull new logs without leaving your editor.
- **Integration Setup**: Configure API keys or credentials for each source directly in VSCode settings.
